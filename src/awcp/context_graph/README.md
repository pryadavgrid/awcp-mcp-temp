# AWCP Context Graph

A durable, tamper-evident **trail of every governed step** an agent takes.

> Plain-English version: every time an AWCP agent does something through the
> control plane, this writes a stamped receipt and staples it to the previous
> one. Follow the staples and you can replay the whole story of a run.

---

## 1. Why this exists (the gap it closes)

The canonical schema (`observability/init-db/02-schema.sql`) defines
`evidence.ledger` with four columns built for exactly this:

| column | meaning |
|---|---|
| `context_hash`   | fingerprint of the state a step acted on |
| `resume_pointer` | opaque cursor — where to resume *after* this step |
| `prev_hash`      | the previous ledger row's hash |
| `row_hash`       | `sha256(prev_hash + this row)` → tamper chain |

But **nothing wrote them.** Worse, the radar's own insert
(`awcp.radar.db._SQL_EVIDENCE`) didn't even list `resume_pointer`. The slots
existed; the receipts were never printed. This package prints them.

It is the first, self-contained slice of the larger **AI harness** design — the
harness's `checkpoint()` method is meant to delegate here once it lands. Nothing
else has to change for this slice to add value.

---

## 2. What a node is

One **node = one governed step** (a tool call, a route decision, a generation).
Consecutive steps in the same run are connected by **edges** (`step N → step N+1`).

```
ContextNode
  ts             when it happened
  workflow_id    the run this step belongs to
  agent_id       who took the step
  task_id        the task within the run
  step           "tool:web_search" | "route" | "generate" | ...
  actor          agent id / "operator" / "gate"
  resume_pointer where to resume after this step (opaque cursor)
  context_hash   fingerprint of the inputs/state it acted on
  prev_hash      previous ledger row hash   ┐ tamper chain
  row_hash       sha256(prev_hash + body)   ┘ (also the node's stable id)
  payload        any extra detail (tool name, gate decision, risk, ...)
```

`row_hash` uses the **same formula** as `awcp.radar.db._row_hash`, so checkpoint
rows extend the *one* evidence chain instead of forking a parallel one.

---

## 3. How it's wired

Two processes are involved. The graph lives in the **radar/gateway** process
(the only one with the Postgres engine); the **MCP server** records over HTTP.

```
MCP server (:8002, separate process)        Radar / Gateway process
────────────────────────────────────        ────────────────────────────────
execute_tool()
  ├─ _radar_gate()      ── allow ──▶
  ├─ run_tool()         (tool runs)
  ├─ _meter_tool_tokens()
  └─ _record_checkpoint() ─ HTTP POST ─▶ /agents/{id}/checkpoint
                                              │  (context_graph.api.router,
                                              │   mounted into the radar router)
                                              ▼
                                         store.record_checkpoint()
                                              ├─ INSERT evidence.ledger
                                              │    (incl. resume_pointer)  ◀── the fix
                                              └─ append in-memory ring (fallback)
```

- The endpoint is mounted into the **radar `APIRouter`** (`awcp.radar.api`), so it
  is served on every surface the radar is (`:8090` standalone **and** the gateway
  `:8000` — which is the port the MCP server's `AGENT_RADAR_URL` actually points
  at).
- Writes go to **Postgres** (durable, survives restart) **and** an in-memory ring
  (instant reads, and the trail still works when Postgres is off).

## 4. HTTP API

| Method & path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `POST /agents/{agent_id}/checkpoint`   | record one step (see `CheckpointRequest`) |
| `GET  /agents/{agent_id}/context-graph`| all steps for one agent |
| `GET  /context-graph/verify`           | re-hash the **whole ledger** and report any break |
| `GET  /context-graph/neo4j/status`     | Neo4j projection connection + node counts |
| `GET  /context-graph/neo4j/graph`      | node-link graph (nodes+edges) for visualization |
| `POST /context-graph/neo4j/backfill`   | mirror existing ledger checkpoints into Neo4j (+ A2A skills) |
| `POST /context-graph/neo4j/sync-cards` | project agents' A2A AgentCard skills into the graph |
| `GET  /context-graph/{workflow_id}/relevance`   | every node scored for relevance (`?focus=`) |
| `GET  /context-graph/{workflow_id}/stale`       | which nodes are stale (aged/superseded/dead branch) |
| `GET  /context-graph/{workflow_id}/working-set` | budget-fitted recovery context (`?budget=&focus=`) |
| `GET  /context-graph/memory/status`    | Letta long-term-memory connection status |
| `POST /context-graph/memory/recall`    | recall durable cross-run memories for a query |
| `GET  /context-graph/{workflow_id}`    | one run's ordered nodes **+ edges** |
| `GET  /context-graph`                  | recent steps across all runs (global feed) |

> Route order matters: `/context-graph/verify` is declared **before**
> `/context-graph/{workflow_id}` so "verify" is a literal path, not a workflow id.

`POST` body (`CheckpointRequest`) — only `step` is required:

```json
{
  "step": "tool:web_search",
  "task_id": "task-123",
  "workflow_id": "run-abc",
  "actor": "ollama-search",
  "resume_pointer": "task-123:after:tool:web_search",
  "context": { "query": "..." },
  "payload": { "tool": "web_search", "decision": "allow", "risk": "low" }
}
```

`GET /context-graph/{workflow_id}` returns:

```json
{
  "workflow_id": "run-abc",
  "count": 3,
  "nodes": [ { "...ContextNode..." } ],
  "edges": [ { "from": "<row_hash>", "to": "<row_hash>", "step": "generate" } ]
}
```

---

## 5. Fail-open by design

Nothing here can break a run:

- No `agent_id` / no radar URL → the client is a no-op.
- Postgres down or `AGENT_RADAR_DATABASE_URL` unset → writes fall back to the
  in-memory ring; reads serve from it.
- Any internal error → logged at `debug`, the handler returns `{"ok": false}` (or
  an empty graph), never a 500.

Env knobs: `AWCP_CONTEXT_GRAPH_RING` (ring size, default `5000`).

---

## 6. Verify / demo it

**In the dashboard:** open the React UI (`:5173` / the gateway) and pick
**Context Graph** in the left menu. Runs are listed on the left; click one to see
its governed-step chain on the right — each step shows its gate decision, risk,
resume pointer, and the `context`/`row` hashes (the tamper chain). It polls live.

**From the CLI** — after triggering an agent that calls a tool:

```bash
# global feed of governed steps
curl -s localhost:8000/context-graph | jq

# one agent's trail
curl -s localhost:8000/agents/ollama-search/context-graph | jq

# one run's graph (nodes + edges)
curl -s localhost:8000/context-graph/<workflow_id> | jq

# straight from Postgres — the rows that used to be empty:
#   SELECT ts, agent_id, step, resume_pointer, left(context_hash,12), left(row_hash,12)
#   FROM evidence.ledger WHERE event_type='checkpoint' ORDER BY ts;
```

You can also record a node by hand to see the chain form:

```bash
curl -s -X POST localhost:8000/agents/demo/checkpoint \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"step":"route","task_id":"t1","context":{"q":"hi"}}' | jq
```

---

## 7. Chain verification (`GET /context-graph/verify`)

Re-derives the **whole `evidence.ledger` chain** and reports any break — a pure
read (`verify.py`). For each row, ordered by `ts`:

- **content** — `row_hash == sha256(prev_hash + canonical(payload))`. Re-hashing
  the stored payload must reproduce the recorded hash → detects an in-place edit.
- **linkage** — `prev_hash == the previous row's row_hash` → detects a deleted,
  reordered, or inserted row (the append-only property).

```json
{ "enabled": true, "intact": true, "total": 7, "content_verified": 7,
  "breaks": [], "note": "7 row(s) verified, chain intact" }
```

Because `canonical()` matches `radar.db`'s body production exactly, **both**
ordinary evidence rows and checkpoint rows verify under one function. `payload` is
`jsonb` (Postgres-normalised), so content verification assumes the payload
round-trips canonically — true for the control plane's string/scalar payloads;
linkage breaks are always definitive. Returns `{"enabled": false}` when Postgres
is off (nothing durable to verify). The DB enforces this at the privilege level
too: the app role (`awcp_app`) has `INSERT`/`SELECT` on `evidence` but **not**
`UPDATE`/`DELETE` — the ledger is append-only.

## 8. Scope & what's intentionally not here

- ✅ Records a node after each governed tool call — **both successful and blocked**
  (a denial is part of the trail: `payload.outcome="blocked"`, `decision="deny"`,
  red in the UI).
- ✅ Writes the full row incl. `resume_pointer`; reuses the existing hash chain.
- ✅ Read endpoints + whole-ledger `verify` + an in-memory fallback for reads.
- ⛔ Does **not** add the `harness_tier` field or the T0–T4 harness classes — that
  is the separate harness phase. This package is the harness's `checkpoint()`
  duty, isolated and shipped first.

---

## 9. Neo4j graph projection (additive read-model)

Postgres `evidence.ledger` stays the **tamper-evident source of truth**. On top of
it, every checkpoint is also **mirrored into Neo4j** (`graph_store.py`) so the trail
can be queried and visualised as a real graph:

```
(:Agent {id})-[:PERFORMED]->(:Step {row_hash,…})<-[:INCLUDES]-(:Workflow {id})
(:Agent)-[:RAN]->(:Workflow)
(:Step)-[:NEXT]->(:Step)            # chronological lineage within one workflow
(:Step)-[:USED]->(:Tool {name})
(:Step)-[:BLOCKED_BY]->(:Policy {name})   # explainability: which gate rule denied it
(:Step)-[:RAISED]->(:Error {message})     # a failed step (per-step, no hub)
(:Agent)-[:HAS_SKILL]->(:Skill {id})      # A2A: capabilities from the agent's AgentCard
```

**A2A wiring.** The merged AgentCard (A2A) feature gives each `AgentEntry` a `skills`
list (its advertised capabilities). The graph reads those from the live registry
and attaches them as `(:Agent)-[:HAS_SKILL]->(:Skill)`. `Skill` nodes are **deduped
by id**, so one `(:Skill {id:"web_search"})` is shared by every agent that
advertises it — which is exactly the A2A *discovery* view ("who can do X?").
Skills attach automatically when an agent records a step, and `POST
/context-graph/neo4j/sync-cards` (also run inside `backfill`) projects skills for
every registered agent up front. So the graph now connects what an agent **can do**
(A2A capability) to what it **did** (provenance). Example query:

```cypher
MATCH (a:Agent)-[:HAS_SKILL]->(s:Skill {id:"web_search"}) RETURN a;   // who can web_search?
```

`Policy` and `Error` nodes are **derived from the checkpoint payload we already
mirror** (gate `mode` for denials, the error message for failures) — no new event
plumbing. They're kept **sparse** (only blocked/failed steps get them, no shared
`approved_by` hub) so the graph stays readable. This gives the "why was this
blocked?" reasoning chain: `Step ─BLOCKED_BY→ Policy{quarantined}`.

- **Additive + fail-open.** If the `neo4j` driver is missing or the DB is down,
  mirroring is a silent no-op and the graph endpoints return `{"enabled": false}` —
  the ledger and the rest of the app are unaffected. Nothing requires Neo4j.
- **Why a projection, not a move:** Neo4j doesn't give append-only / hash-chain
  tamper-evidence for free; Postgres does (and enforces it at the privilege level).
  So Postgres keeps integrity; Neo4j adds graph queries + the dashboard's **Graph**
  view (`ui/src/components/Neo4jGraph.jsx`).

Run it:

```bash
docker compose -f observability/docker-compose.yml up -d neo4j   # Browser :7474 · Bolt :7687
curl -s -X POST localhost:8000/context-graph/neo4j/backfill | jq  # project existing history (once)
# new checkpoints auto-mirror as they are recorded
```

Config (env): `AWCP_NEO4J_URL` (default `bolt://localhost:7687`), `AWCP_NEO4J_USER`
(`neo4j`), `AWCP_NEO4J_PASSWORD` (`awcpneo4j`), `AWCP_NEO4J_ENABLED` (`true`).
Explore in the Neo4j Browser (`http://localhost:7474`):

```cypher
MATCH (a:Agent)-[:PERFORMED]->(s:Step) RETURN a, s LIMIT 50;
MATCH p=(:Step)-[:NEXT*]->(:Step) RETURN p LIMIT 25;       // lineage chains
```

## 10. Files

## 11. Context Graph Manager (the smart-memory layer)

Sections 1–10 are the **receipt book** — a tamper-evident record of *what
happened*. `manager.py` is the **Context Graph Manager**: it *reasons* over that
trail instead of just storing it. It answers the three questions a recovering
workflow actually has, and it writes nothing (pure reads over `store`, fail-open):

1. **Relevance scoring** — `GET /context-graph/{wf}/relevance?focus=<text>`.
   Each node gets a 0–1 score from four explainable components, normalised over
   whichever apply:
   - **recency** — exponential decay on age (half-life `AWCP_CTX_RECENCY_HALFLIFE_S`, 30 min);
   - **step** — how much context a step carries (`generate`/`synthesize` > `tool` > `route` > `checkpoint`);
   - **outcome** — blocked/denied/errored steps are down-weighted;
   - **focus** — lexical overlap with an optional focus query (the current task).
   The response includes the per-node `components` so a score is always explainable.

2. **Stale-context detection** — `GET /context-graph/{wf}/stale`. A node is stale
   (and must **not** seed recovery as if it were live state) when it is:
   - **aged** — older than `AWCP_CTX_STALE_MAX_AGE_S` (1 h) relative to the newest step;
   - **superseded** — a later *state-producing* step (`route`/`generate`/`synthesize`)
     in the same task replaced this snapshot (tool calls are never "superseded" —
     two searches with different queries are both valid);
   - **dead_branch** — the step was blocked, denied, or errored, so its action never
     took effect.
   Each stale node carries its `stale_reasons`.

3. **Token-budget management** — `GET /context-graph/{wf}/working-set?budget=<tokens>&focus=<text>`.
   This is the headline output: the relevance-ranked, staleness-filtered slice of
   context that actually **fits a context window**, plus the **resume anchor**. It:
   1. scores + flags every node; 2. keeps only **fresh** nodes; 3. always seats the
   newest fresh node first (the resume point); 4. greedily adds the rest by
   relevance until the next would bust the budget; 5. spends any leftover budget on
   Letta long-term recall (§13); 6. returns the selection in chronological order
   with `used_tokens`, `dropped`, `excluded_stale`, and `resume_pointer`.
   Token counts use **tiktoken** when present, else a chars/4 heuristic — so it
   degrades, never breaks. The default budget is `AWCP_CTX_TOKEN_BUDGET` (4000).

   > This is the *context-window* sibling of laminar's *spend* budget
   > (`laminar/budget.py`): laminar caps how many tokens an agent may **spend** per
   > window; the manager picks which context tokens to **carry** into a recovery.
   > One mental model, two budgets.

All weights/half-lives/thresholds are env-tunable (`AWCP_CTX_W_RECENCY`,
`AWCP_CTX_W_STEP`, `AWCP_CTX_W_OUTCOME`, `AWCP_CTX_W_FOCUS`, …) so nothing is
hardcoded, matching `radar/policy.py` / `laminar/budget.py`.

```bash
# what should a recovering run carry forward, in 2000 tokens, for this task?
curl -s "localhost:8000/context-graph/<wf>/working-set?budget=2000&focus=gold%20price" | jq
# why is some context being dropped?
curl -s "localhost:8000/context-graph/<wf>/stale" | jq
```

## 12. Context offload / recall (the context-window pressure valve)

The manager (§11) answers "what should a *recovering* run carry?". This layer
lets a **live agent use the graph as spill-over memory** — the core promise:
an agent on a long-running task with a limited context window can **off-load**
context into the graph and **retrieve** it later, exactly when needed.

Two MCP tools (in `awcp.mcp.server`, so every governed agent has them):

| tool | what it does |
|---|---|
| `context_offload(content, label, agent_id, task_id)` | Stores `content` **verbatim** on a tamper-chained node (`step="offload:<label>"`, content in `payload.content`, also hashed into `context_hash`). Returns a tiny ref: `{ref, label, resume_pointer, tokens}`. The agent drops the content from its window and keeps the ref. |
| `context_recall(agent_id, task_id, ref="", focus="", budget=0)` | **With `ref`** (row_hash or unique prefix): returns that exact chunk verbatim. **Without `ref`**: returns the manager's working set — the relevance-ranked, staleness-filtered steps that fit `budget` tokens (offloaded chunks come back verbatim, ordinary steps as summaries), plus the resume anchor and Letta memories. |

Design points:

- **Both actions are themselves recorded** (`offload:<label>` / `recall` steps),
  so offload/recall traffic is visible on the dashboard flow (📤 / 📥 nodes) and
  in the evidence ledger — the trail *is* the audit of the agent's memory use.
- **Re-offloading a label supersedes the old snapshot**: `_superseded` keys
  offloads by `(task_id, full step)`, so "findings v2" makes "findings v1"
  stale without touching other labels. Offloads are top-weighted carried
  context (`_STEP_WEIGHTS["offload"]=1.0`); recall markers are near-zero
  (`0.2`) so bookkeeping never crowds real context out of the budget.
- **Size-capped** via `AWCP_CTX_OFFLOAD_MAX_CHARS` (default 20000; truncation
  is flagged in the ref). Fail-open like everything else: if the radar is
  unreachable, offload returns an explicit error telling the agent to keep the
  content in its window.
- HTTP plumbing lives in `client.py` (`record_checkpoint` now returns the
  created node so the caller gets its `row_hash` ref; plus
  `fetch_working_set` / `fetch_workflow_nodes`).

```python
# agent-side pattern for a long-running task
ref = context_offload(content=big_findings, label="findings",
                      agent_id=me, task_id=task)          # → park it, free the window
...                                                        # window stays small
back = context_recall(agent_id=me, task_id=task, ref=ref["ref"])   # exact chunk
ws   = context_recall(agent_id=me, task_id=task, budget=3000,
                      focus="gold price")                  # or: best slice that fits
```

Tests: `tests/context_graph/test_offload_recall.py` (round-trip, ranking,
per-label supersede — all on the in-memory ring, no Postgres needed).

## 13. Letta long-term memory (optional, fail-open)

`memory.py` adds the **durable, cross-run** memory the brochure names as a partner:
**Letta** (formerly MemGPT). Postgres stays the per-run trail and Neo4j the graph
view; Letta is the layer that remembers across runs.

- **Remember** — every recorded checkpoint is also pushed into Letta's archival
  memory (best-effort, from `store.record_checkpoint`, right after the Neo4j mirror).
- **Recall** — `POST /context-graph/memory/recall` (and automatically, inside
  `working-set`) pulls the most relevant past memories for a query and folds them in
  as `source:"memory"` nodes, so recovery can use knowledge from *earlier* runs.
- **Additive + fail-open + config-driven.** Reached over Letta's **REST API via
  httpx** (no SDK import to satisfy); if Letta is off, unreachable, or
  `AWCP_LETTA_AGENT_ID` is unset, every call is a silent no-op / empty result and
  the rest of the app is unaffected. Letta's REST surface has drifted across
  versions, so the insert/search/health **paths** are env-overridable — adapting to
  a new version is a config change, not a code change.

Config (env): `AWCP_LETTA_ENABLED` (`true`), `AWCP_LETTA_BASE_URL`
(`http://localhost:8283`), `AWCP_LETTA_AGENT_ID` (**required** to enable),
`AWCP_LETTA_TOKEN`, `AWCP_LETTA_TIMEOUT` (`4`), and the `AWCP_LETTA_*_PATH` knobs.

```bash
curl -s localhost:8000/context-graph/memory/status | jq          # {enabled,connected,...}
curl -s -X POST localhost:8000/context-graph/memory/recall \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"query":"gold price","limit":5}' | jq
