"""An autonomous, governed PydanticAI WORKER runtime — the REPORT-WRITER agent.

This is the AWCP magazine's "reliable agent" proof slice, dropped in as a new
folder (Operating Model Step 01: register + attach control hooks; Scenario C:
quarantine -> active once telemetry / flags / policy callbacks are observed).

Pulls GOALS (a topic) off the task queue and executes each in multiple steps:
  - read/compute tools: web_search, current_time, ...   (gather facts)
  - save_artifact  -> governed LOCAL write  (the report file; gated)
  - external_post  -> governed EXTERNAL write (high risk, gated + needs approval)

The write is the point: every report it produces is a write-capable action that
must pass the radar's gate (Operating Model Step 03). Because this agent is rated
`high` in the magazine, the persist step pauses for a narrow, expiring approval
token (Scenario B) before the report lands.

Queue/worker/governance/approval/UI all live in awcp_kit; this file only supplies
the PydanticAI agent + the run_goal() hook, exactly like the sibling agents —
nothing about governance is re-implemented here.

Run as:  python writeup_agent.py   (absolute path via run.sh so the detector sees
the `pydantic_ai` import and classifies the framework).
